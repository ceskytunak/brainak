## About vitamin B12

Vitamin B12, also known as cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for human health. It is the largest and most complex vitamin, and it is the only vitamin that contains a metal atom (cobalt).

Vitamin B12 is found naturally in animal products, such as meat, poultry, fish, eggs, and dairy products. It is not found in plant foods. Vitamin B12 can also be produced by bacteria in the gut, but this absorption is not very efficient.

The recommended daily intake of vitamin B12 for adults is 2.4 micrograms. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers need more vitamin B12, with recommended daily intakes of 2.8 micrograms and 2.6 micrograms, respectively.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is rare in developed countries, but it can occur in people who have a poor diet or who have certain medical conditions, such as celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, or pernicious anemia (an autoimmune disease that damages the cells in the stomach that produce a protein necessary for vitamin B12 absorption). Symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency can include fatigue, weakness, anemia, neurological problems, and dementia.

Vitamin B12 supplements are available, and they are especially important for people who do not eat animal products. Vitamin B12 supplements are also recommended for people over the age of 50, as the body becomes less efficient at absorbing vitamin B12 from food as we age.

### Here are some of the health benefits of vitamin B12:

- Improved red blood cell production: Vitamin B12 is essential for the production of red blood cells, which carry oxygen throughout the body. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to anemia, a condition in which the blood does not have enough healthy red blood cells.
- Improved nervous system function: Vitamin B12 is important for the function of the nervous system. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to neurological problems, such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, muscle weakness, and vision problems.
- Improved cognitive function: Vitamin B12 is important for cognitive function, including memory, attention, and learning. Vitamin B12 deficiency can lead to dementia and other cognitive problems.
- Reduced risk of heart disease: Vitamin B12 may help to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels and preventing blood clots from forming.
- Stronger bones: Vitamin B12 may help to improve bone density and reduce the risk of osteoporosis.

Overall, vitamin B12 is an important vitamin for human health. It plays a role in a variety of bodily functions and has a number of potential health benefits.
