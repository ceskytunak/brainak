## About vitamin B6

Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin that is essential for human health. It plays a role in over 100 different enzyme reactions in the body, including the metabolism of amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids. Vitamin B6 is also important for the production of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body.

Vitamin B6 is found in a variety of foods, including meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds. It can also be produced in the body from the amino acid tryptophan, but this process is not very efficient.

The recommended daily intake of vitamin B6 for adults is 1.3 milligrams for men and 1.2 milligrams for women. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers need more vitamin B6, with recommended daily intakes of 1.9 milligrams and 2 milligrams, respectively.

Vitamin B6 deficiency is rare in developed countries, but it can occur in people who have a poor diet or who have certain medical conditions, such as alcoholism, chronic kidney disease, or inflammatory bowel disease. Symptoms of vitamin B6 deficiency can include anemia, dermatitis, depression, and confusion.

Vitamin B6 supplements are available, but they should only be taken under the supervision of a healthcare professional. High doses of vitamin B6 can cause side effects such as numbness and tingling in the hands and feet, sensitivity to light, and nausea.

### Here are some of the health benefits of vitamin B6:

- Improved mood and cognitive function: Vitamin B6 is involved in the production of serotonin and dopamine, two neurotransmitters that play a role in mood and cognitive function. Studies have shown that vitamin B6 supplementation can improve mood and cognitive function in people with depression, anxiety, and Alzheimer's disease.
- Reduced risk of heart disease: Vitamin B6 can help to reduce cholesterol levels and inflammation, two risk factors for heart disease.
- Reduced risk of stroke: Vitamin B6 can help to reduce the risk of stroke by preventing blood clots from forming.
- Improved athletic performance: Vitamin B6 is necessary for the metabolism of glycogen, the body's main source of energy during exercise. Studies have shown that vitamin B6 supplementation can improve athletic performance and reduce muscle fatigue.
- Reduced symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS): Vitamin B6 supplementation has been shown to reduce the symptoms of PMS, such as mood swings, bloating, and breast tenderness.
- Overall, vitamin B6 is an important vitamin for human health. It plays a role in a variety of bodily functions and has a number of potential health benefits.
