# Recipe for BrainZap! Easy 

BrainZap! Easy is a simple and effective brain booster that uses common ingredients to deliver long-lasting caffeine effects without the jitters.

It works by combining caffeine from different natural sources, each with its own release profile. Pure caffeine is absorbed quickly, matcha tea releases caffeine over a longer period of time, and guarana releases caffeine even more slowly. This results in a steady stream of caffeine entering your bloodstream, providing sustained energy and focus for up to six hours.

BrainZap! Easy is a great alternative to sugary energy drinks and coffee crashes. It's also perfect for people who are sensitive to caffeine, as it doesn't cause the same spike and crash as other caffeine sources.
