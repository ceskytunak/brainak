# Ingredient Beetroot

## About Beetroot

Beetroot is a popular ingredient in dietary supplements, and for good reason. It is a rich source of nutrients, including vitamins A, C, and B12, as well as minerals such as iron, potassium, and magnesium. Beetroot is also a good source of nitrates, which are converted into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator, meaning that it widens blood vessels. This can improve blood flow and circulation throughout the body.

Beetroot supplements are often marketed as a way to improve athletic performance. This is because the nitrates in beetroot can increase oxygen delivery to the muscles during exercise. Beetroot supplements have also been shown to improve cognitive function and reduce blood pressure.

### Here are some of the potential benefits of taking beetroot supplements:

- Improved athletic performance: Beetroot supplements can increase oxygen delivery to the muscles during exercise, which can lead to improved athletic performance.
- Improved cognitive function: Beetroot supplements have been shown to improve cognitive function in both healthy people and people with cognitive impairments.
- Reduced blood pressure: Beetroot supplements can lower blood pressure by widening blood vessels.
- Improved cardiovascular health: Beetroot supplements may improve cardiovascular health by reducing inflammation and improving endothelial function.
- Increased energy levels: Beetroot supplements may increase energy levels by improving circulation and oxygen delivery to the tissues.
- Beetroot supplements are generally safe for most people to take. However, it is important to talk to your doctor before taking any dietary supplements, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking any medications.

Beetroot supplements are available in a variety of forms, including capsules, powder, and extract. The recommended dosage of beetroot supplements varies depending on the form in which they are taken. For capsules, the recommended dosage is 500-1000 milligrams per day. For powder, the recommended dosage is 1-2 grams per day. For extract, the recommended dosage is 250-500 milligrams per day.

If you are considering taking beetroot supplements, be sure to choose a high-quality product from a reputable manufacturer.

Betacyanins are the pigments that give beetroot its characteristic red color. They have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Antioxidants help to protect the body from damage caused by free radicals. Free radicals are unstable molecules that can damage cells and contribute to disease. Nitrates are converted into nitric oxide in the body. Nitric oxide is a vasodilator, meaning that it widens blood vessels. This can improve blood flow and circulation throughout the body.

Dried beetroot is a good source of nutrients and other beneficial compounds. It can be consumed as a snack or added to salads, soups, and stews. It can also be used to make beetroot powder, which can be added to smoothies, juices, and baked goods.
