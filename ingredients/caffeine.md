## About caffeine

Pure caffeine is a white, bitter powder that is extracted from coffee beans, tea leaves, and other plants. It is a stimulant that increases alertness, wakefulness, and energy levels. Caffeine is consumed by millions of people around the world in the form of coffee, tea, soda, energy drinks, and other products.

Caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a neurotransmitter that makes you feel tired. Adenosine levels build up throughout the day, contributing to feelings of fatigue. Caffeine blocks adenosine receptors, preventing them from binding to adenosine and making you feel tired.

Caffeine also increases the release of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that plays a role in motivation, reward, and pleasure. This is why caffeine can make you feel more alert and motivated.

Pure caffeine is more potent than caffeine found in food and beverages. It is important to consume pure caffeine safely and to avoid overdosing.
